**How to read this:**
- **65 items genuinely shipped** — infrastructure density is much higher than expected (message rate-limiting, debt recovery, rollback, reconnect, alerting, codegen, hot-reload, ECS decoupling, clang-tidy plugins…)
- **101 items partial** — the largest bucket; most have a design doc / skeleton / TODO comment but are not closed out. **Highest ROI area for gap-filling next.**
- **92 items not done** — a mix of gameplay features (red envelopes / quiz / spectate) and real engineering gaps (distributed tracing, error reporting, auction house, chat ad filtering…)
- **28 items are principle notes / duplicates / marked deleted** — recommended for removal from todo

## 3. 🟡 Partial — high-ROI gap-fill candidates

These are **the most worthwhile next investments** — design doc exists / skeleton in place / TODO comments present, just need the last mile:

| # | Item | What's missing |
|---|---|---|
| **#102** | Server-open rate limiting (Bucket4j + Redis + wave-based admission) | Design complete, Java skeleton written; **steps 2–10 marked ⬜ incomplete** |
| **#51/#139/#241** | National mourning day / maintenance auto time-shift for activities | `activity_maintenance_auto_shift.md` exists; code layer not wired up |
| **#76/#75** | Message tamper detection | adler32 checksum in place; HMAC signature missing |
| **#97** | Unified RPC error `reason` field | `error_tip` table exists; call sites not fully covered |
| **#106/#119** | Message priority queue | AOI priority + DoubleBufferQueue present; dedicated "priority message queue" missing |
| **#204/#226** | proto-compare-driven unified dirty-save | Currently manual dirty flags |
| **#238/#242/#243/#280** | DB disconnect / incomplete save + save-before-load on scene exit | `player_lifecycle.cpp:376` has `// TODO: Only allow re-login after save completes` |
| **#208** | Cross-scene-server player-to-player messaging | Design doc `cross_scene_player_messaging.md` has extensive TODO markers |
| **#247** | Protocol version compatibility | proto3 is inherently compatible; dedicated version layer missing |
| **#210** | External-to-internal network data isolation | `k8s_gate_exposure_guidance.md` + `AdminApiKeyFilter` exist; dedicated code guardrails missing |
| **#216** | Signal to dump all thread stack traces | `PrintDefaultStackTrace()` + `thread_observability.h` present; SIGUSR1 entry point missing |
| **#225** | Subtle difference between complete_quest vs add_complete_quest | Two code paths exist with **no comment explaining the difference** — confirmed tech debt |
| **#223** | WeChat/QQ real OAuth sandbox e2e | Runbook ready; **blocked on real AppId/AppSecret** |

---

## 4. ❌ Not done — TOP 15 by risk/value

### 🔴 Production incident defenses (fix soon)

| # | Item | Pain point |
|---|---|---|
| **#152** | Distributed tracing (jaeger/zipkin/otel) | No fast root-cause path when incidents occur (see also #27); currently only incidental otel from go-redis vendor — business traces not instrumented |
| **#250** | Dev-cycle error reporting to a central service (Sentry / homegrown) | Failures only discovered after the fact; no real-time aggregation |
| **#273** | Build version tagging + binary/source archiving | Cannot reproduce the exact build at time of a production bug |
| **#105** | Missing logout_time on player crash | Key timestamp absent for post-incident forensics |
| **#236** | Log or kick player after N illegal protocol packets | MessageLimiter handles rate, but illegal packet count is not tracked → cannot block cheat clients |

### 🟠 Anti-cheat / Security

| # | Item | Pain point |
|---|---|---|
| **#68** | Chat ad / sensitive-word filtering | Chat will be spammed with ads once enabled |
| **#207** | Cross-server currency deduction authentication | Debt recovery exists (#59), but **preventive** deduction auth is absent |

### 🟡 Gameplay infrastructure (product-priority dependent)

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **#16/#150/#198/#201** | Spectate / replay / switch to teammate view | Same feature block — entirely absent |
| **#115** | 500k concurrent cross-server queue | Only small-scale 5v5/3v3 matchmaking; large-scale open-server / cross-server queue missing (see also #98/#102) |
| **#33/#34/#35** | Red envelopes / quiz / voting | Three classic live-ops features — all absent |
| **#269** | NPC dialogue system | Not built |
| **#165** | Auction house system | Entire system missing |
| **#283** | Offline player reward delivery at activity end | Mail compensation mechanism absent |

### ⚪ Basic capabilities

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **#28/#130** | User behavior analytics / feature telemetry | No data-driven way to cut unused features |
| **#19** | i18n / multi-language | Not built |
| **#45** | Merge servers when character slots are full | Ops scenario |
| **#48** | Cross-server disconnect reconnect | Same-server reconnect done (#256); cross-server not done |
| **#50** | Stop showing "too frequent" after a successful action | MessageLimiter has no reset hook |

---

## 5. ➖ N/A — 28 items to drop from todo

### Explicitly marked (5 items)
- #8 (duplicate of #2) · #18 (author note: "Delete this todo") · #24 (client-side) · #174 (duplicate of #154) · #14 (principle)

### Pure principle notes (19 items — coding philosophy, not deliverables)
#153–155, #158–162, #168–169, #172–176, #181–183, #191, #197

> All of these express the same class of idea: "fewer call hops → fewer bugs", "code readable at a glance", "decoupled systems", "don't over-engineer"… Recommend either deleting them or moving them to a dedicated `coding_principles.md` — they don't belong in a task backlog.

### Client / product-facing (4 items)
- #24 Harry-Potter-style download loading screen
- #196 In-game pause (not applicable for MMO)
- #232 "Debugging multiple places for one issue = messy code" (observation note)
- #252 "Can players log in after the server runs past midnight without a restart?" (question, not a task)

---

## 6. Contradictions / tech debt discovered

Several inconsistencies found during the audit that need a decision:

### 1. **Raw pointer check inconsistency**
- #47/#274 claim the `cpp/plugin/NoMemberRawPointerCheck.cpp` clang-tidy plugin enforces the ban
- #186 audit found `cpp/libs/modules/currency/currency_system.h` **has raw pointer members**
- **Conclusion:** The plugin either has a whitelist, or is not yet active for the `modules/` directory — recommend running a full clang-tidy pass to identify which modules are being skipped

### 2. **#225 MissionSystem two paths with no comments**
`CompleteAllMissions` and `OnMissionCompletion` appear to do the same thing but **are genuinely two distinct code paths** with **no comments explaining the difference**. This matches the warning in todo item #225: "looks like the same logic, but has subtle differences." Confirmed tech debt.

### 3. **#280 explicit TODO comment**
`cpp/libs/services/scene/player/system/player_lifecycle.cpp:376` contains:
```
// TODO: Only allow re-login after save completes
```
This is a confirmed incomplete mechanism; #242/#243 both point to the same location.
**✅ 2026-05-14 shipped** — using a "layered defense" strategy instead of a new state machine: same-node reconnect dropped by `EnterScene` clearing the `UnregisterPlayer` marker (pre-existing); cross-node reconnect gated by `player_locator` 30s lease (pre-existing); extreme window (save > 30s) now emits `LOG_WARN` from `HandlePlayerAsyncSaved` for ops visibility. Added proto field `UnregisterPlayer.logout_initiated_ms` and API `PlayerLifecycleSystem::IsSaveInFlight(playerId)`.

---

## 7. Recommended next-step priority

Ordered by **ROI (value / effort)**:

### P0 — Worth doing within two weeks
1. **#102 Server-open rate limiting close-out** — design fully written, Java skeleton ready, just need to complete steps 2–10.
2. **#280/#242/#243 Race condition: re-login before save completes** — TODO comment confirmed, risk is clear, close the loop.
3. **#70/#125 Print full request proto + stack trace on error code** — infrastructure already in place (stacktrace_system + error_tip), just add a unified hook.
4. **#216 SIGUSR1 dump all thread stack traces** — `PrintDefaultStackTrace()` already exists, just register the signal handler.

### P1 — Within one month
5. **#152 Distributed tracing** — pick otel, instrument go/java/cpp all three layers together. Bundle with #27/#250.
6. **#236 Illegal packet counter + kick** — add an `IllegalPacketCounter` alongside MessageLimiter.
7. **#273 Build version archiving** — include git-sha + source tarball in CI artifacts.
8. **#225 MissionSystem two-path comments** — pure documentation work, but prevents future developers from stepping on the same landmine.

### P2 — By product priority
- #16/#201/#198 Spectate / replay — same feature block
- #165 Auction house — new system
- #33/#34/#35 Red envelopes / quiz / voting — live-ops features

### Recommended immediate cleanup
- Remove the 28 ➖ N/A items from todo (or move to `coding_principles.md`) to reduce noise.
- Add ✅ marker + evidence path to each completed item (following the format of #219/#220/#222/#224) so future readers of todo don't waste time re-investigating.

## Contradictions / tech debt — needs your call

### ① Raw-pointer check appears to have gaps ⚠️
- **Claimed:** #47/#274 — clang-tidy plugin `cpp/plugin/NoMemberRawPointerCheck.cpp` enforces
- **Actual:** #186 agent found `cpp/libs/modules/currency/currency_system.h` **does have raw pointer members**
- **Conclusion:** Plugin either has a whitelist, or hasn't been applied across `cpp/libs/modules/` yet
- **Suggestion:** Run a full clang-tidy pass on `cpp/libs/modules/` to verify coverage

### ② MissionSystem two paths unannotated
- **Location:** `cpp/libs/modules/mission/` — `CompleteAllMissions` vs `OnMissionCompletion`
- **Problem:** Two paths look identical in purpose, code actually diverges, but **no comments explain the difference**
- **Reference:** todo #225 original warning: "looks like the same logic, but has subtle differences"
- **Suggestion:** 5-minute fix — add 3 lines of comment explaining when each path is called

### ③ #280 has explicit TODO comment
- **Location:** `cpp/libs/services/scene/player/system/player_lifecycle.cpp:376`
- **Text:** `// TODO: Only allow re-login after save completes`
- **Reference:** todo #280/#242/#243 all point to the same issue
- **Suggestion:** This is a **state-machine problem** — add a "saving" state, re-login requests in that state should wait or be rejected
- **✅ 2026-05-14 shipped:** Layered defense instead of a new state machine:
  1. Same-node reconnect already cleared by `EnterScene` dropping the `UnregisterPlayer` marker (pre-existing)
  2. Cross-node reconnect already gated by `player_locator` 30s lease (pre-existing)
  3. Extreme window (save > 30s): `HandlePlayerAsyncSaved` now emits LOG_WARN — ops can observe
  - New proto field: `UnregisterPlayer.logout_initiated_ms` records save-initiation time
  - New API: `PlayerLifecycleSystem::IsSaveInFlight(playerId)` for callers that want to query

## How to use this file

1. **For scheduling:** Pull from P0 / P1; each item has effort and dependencies, estimate sprints directly.
2. **For retrospectives:** Use the ✅ section to show your manager "these are done".
3. **For adding new todos:** Go to `todo.md` (thought-stream); this file only reflects items already audited.
4. **Next audit:** Re-run audit in 3 months (reuse the agent prompt from `todo_audit_2026_05_11.md`); states will migrate.

## I. Readability / Maintenance Cost

### 1. Keep call depth shallow — logic should be traceable at a glance
> Source: #153 #154 #160 #174 #181

**Core idea:** Fewer call chains → fewer bugs → lower comprehension cost → lower maintenance cost.

- Like indentation depth: can you tell at a glance what the code is doing?
- When a bug appears, can you spot it immediately?
- Too many call levels = technical debt = chasing bugs across multiple files, high cost to read.

**Practical heuristic:** If you need to set breakpoints in more than 3 places to track down one issue, that's a signal the logic is too tangled (see #232).

---

### 2. One-sentence summary — check that code lives in the right place
> Source: #159

**How to apply:** After writing a piece of logic, summarize it in one sentence. Then ask whether that sentence flows naturally with the surrounding code.

**Typical anti-pattern:** A block of logic that's really just "toggle UI visibility" ends up sitting inside a data-fetching interface. Write the one-sentence summary and it becomes obvious: this belongs in a "view became visible" hook (see #180).

---

### 3. Code should show what it's doing at a glance
> Source: #155 #160

Code should expose **what / flow / order** explicitly — code you can't understand probably has a bug hiding in it.

---

### 4. Simple code is where bugs hide
> Source: #88

Simple code is actually bug-prone, because nobody reads it carefully. **For anything that looks trivial, ask yourself: have all edge cases been covered?**

---

### 5. When code is obscure, don't debug it — rewrite it
> Source: #158

If a piece of code is so opaque you don't know where to start debugging, that's a sign it needs to be rewritten, not debugged.

---

## II. Debugging / Self-Review Habits

### 6. Go back and re-read your own code; use an LLM to review it
> Source: #162

Don't commit right away. Come back after half a day or a day — you'll catch things. **Run it past ChatGPT/Claude too; an LLM is a free reviewer.**

---

### 7. Step back from your current approach — try a different angle
> Source: #183

When you're stuck in an approach that isn't working, drop it and **start fresh with a completely different angle**. Grinding away at the same dead end costs more time in the long run.

---

## III. Abstraction / Refactoring

### 8. The goal of refactoring, abstraction, and polymorphism is to reduce complexity
> Source: #173

The **only** criterion for any architecture move: is it simpler or more complex after the change?

> If it looks more "sophisticated" but is harder to understand — it's a failure.

---

### 9. Only abstract when there's genuine repetition
> Source: #121 #175

**Anti-pattern:** Writing an abstraction to "demonstrate a design pattern."

**Right pattern:** You spot 3 places with genuinely duplicated code → then abstract. **Single use = don't abstract.**

---

### 10. Function granularity — reusable functions should not call other reusable functions
> Source: #117

**Keep layers clear:** The smallest reusable unit should be a leaf node only. Reusable functions calling other reusable functions makes granularity muddy.

```
┌─ Business function (chains steps in logical order)
│   ├─ Reusable fn A  ← leaf, no further nesting
│   ├─ Reusable fn B  ← leaf
│   └─ Reusable fn C  ← leaf
```

---

### 11. Logic flow should have clear steps: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
> Source: #118

Take Unity's lifecycle as a reference (Awake / OnEnable / Start / OnDisable / OnDestroy): each step is a well-defined abstraction at a clear point in the sequence.

---

## IV. System Design Principles

### 12. A system should only change when new functionality is added — otherwise it stays put (Open/Closed Principle)
> Source: #197

Adding a feature = adding code; **don't touch existing code**. Other systems should have no effect on mine. That's the definition of "stable."

---

### 13. Decouple systems as much as possible
> Source: #172

Two systems may be related at the business level; at the code level, keep them as independent as possible. **Reuse is fine, mutual dependency is not.**

---

### 14. Don't add extension hooks inside foundational functionality
> Source: #182

**Right direction:** Extension code → calls foundational code.
**Wrong direction:** Stuffing business-specific extensions into foundational code (e.g., putting packet-send conditions inside the network layer, see #190).

---

### 15. One field, one meaning
> Source: #168

Classic anti-pattern: using `count = -1` to mean "not retrievable" — that's cramming two concepts into one field.
**Right approach:** count is a count; "is retrievable" is a separate field.
**Analogy:** A function does one thing.

---

### 16. System–developer contract: predictability
> Source: #161

If a developer uses the system by the rules, **the result should be predictable**. Predictable = testable = usable system.
A system where you don't know what will happen after a read or write is a system you can't rely on.

---

### 17. Everything needs a real use case
> Source: #175

Don't use a technology just to use it. **Start with an actual scenario, then pick the technology — not the other way around.**

---

## V. Lessons from Past Mistakes

### 18. Too many call chains and callbacks in the past
> Source: #169

Retrospective note: previous project code had call chains and callbacks nested too deep — impossible to follow the call graph or code path.

**Self-reminder:** Keep checking principle #1 (shallow call depth) as you write code.

---

### 19. Keep framework wrappers simple
> Source: #14

Goal: simple enough that **a newcomer can write server code**. Complex frameworks = slow onboarding = harder to find the right people = poor project longevity.

---

### 20. Data volume is enormous at launch
> Source: #176

**Battle-tested wisdom:** Every design decision needs to account for "launch day traffic is 100× normal."
- Will lists overflow?
- Will the database fill up?
- Will the cache get stampeded?

## How to use this document

1. **Before writing code:** You don't need to read through it every time, but **when you hit a design decision** (abstract or not? split into modules or not?) come back and check.
2. **During code review:** Use this as a checklist. If someone violates a principle, cite the number — no need to argue.
3. **New hire onboarding:** This is the condensed version of "why the project is written this way" — more code-level than ARCH.md.
4. **Don't keep adding new items** — unless you've genuinely found a new principle that keeps surfacing across multiple todo entries. Continuously adding will erode its value as a checklist.
